    "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks that closely resemble natural neural networks. Unlike traditional multi-layer perceptron networks, SNNs take into account the temporal aspect of information processing. In SNNs, neurons do not transmit information at the end of each propagation cycle. Instead, they only send out signals when their membrane potential, which represents the neuron's electrical charge across its membrane, surpasses a certain threshold value."
